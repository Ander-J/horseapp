## About

This project was developed for the Telia internship program. The choice of framework was free, so I went for Angular.
I chose Angular because I didn't have the time to study anything new for the test, as I was doing other internship tests at the same time.

If I had the time, I would have tried learning and writing the project in React as it was mentioned to be the language they use at the company.

Though there is still a lot of improvement to be made and things I didn't have time to implement, I am overall happy with how the project turned out.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
